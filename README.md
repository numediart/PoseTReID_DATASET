***PoseTReID*** is a generic framework which combines detector, tracker, and re-identifier in order to effectively track specific people across multiple cameras or video scenes, in both short and long term for distributed contexts of people interaction spaces such as malls or amusement parks, etc. Check our paper for more details -> [[IEEE]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9271712).

## ðŸ–´ Dataset #1: `GTA_V_DATASET`

</div>

`GTA_V_DATASET` dataset is specifically designed for testing our ***PoseTReID*** in our distributed contexts. All videos were rendered in 16:9 ratio at a resolution of 1080p with our custom script. Afterwards, they were down-scaled to 720p to fit our real-time testing scenarios and to be more realistic like real-life cameras. 

The ground-truth is provided in 2 different formats such as `.txt` and `.csv` for every video with the real IDs (names) of the characters.

### ðŸ†• Updated 2023:

The new ground-truth consists of bouding boxes of `[x y width height]` and `[x1 y1 x2 y2]`, semi-generated by [`pyppbox`](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox) V3 using the following modules:
  - Detector = YOLO Ultralytics V8 (`yolov8l.pt`, `conf=0.5`, `iou=0.7`, `imgsz=416`)
  - Tracker = SORT
  - ReIDer = DeepReID (OSNet-AIN) + Custom

Each line in the ground-truth text file represents a person in a frame, and it contains info separated by `\t` as following:

`Frame index` `\t` `Represent point (x, y)` `\t` `Name ID` `\t` `Box [x y width height]` `\t` `Box [x1 y1 x2 y2]`
